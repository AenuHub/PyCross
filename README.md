## PyCross üê¢

A fun and interactive Python game where players help a turtle safely cross a busy road, dodging cars and overcoming challenges.

### Features

- **Dynamic gameplay**: Increasing difficulty as the game progresses.
- **Intuitive controls**: Easy-to-use keyboard inputs for player movement.
- **Custom visuals**: Designed using Python's Turtle graphics module.
- **High-score tracking**: Challenge yourself to beat your best score.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Turtle module (pre-installed with Python)

### How to Play

The goal of PyCross is simple: guide your turtle across the screen using `Up ‚Üë` key while avoiding the cars zooming by. 
As you successfully cross, the challenge increases with faster cars and trickier patterns.

Stay focused and aim for the highest score!

### Possible Future Improvements 
- Add distinct levels with road layouts with increased difficulty.
- Include additional obstacles or power-ups.
- Use better animation and sound effects for the turtle, vehicles and environment.
- Introduce a cooperative multiplayer mode.
